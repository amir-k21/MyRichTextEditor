# MyRichTextEditor
This is a rich text editor made from Javafx HTMLEditor

for Save function I allowed everything but the things that i tried and worked fine where HTML,RTF and TXT.

for saving to txt it doesn't just save the text it saves it with all the tags so if later you opened it with something that could read those tags you would get the same richtext file.

You can use launch4j to convert the jar to exe and then use inno to make the exe installable.
